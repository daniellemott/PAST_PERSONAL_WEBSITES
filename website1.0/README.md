Welcome to my website üòä

*Who am I?*

I am a:
* Second year student at Queen's University (Elon Musk, alumnus) specializing in Computing & Mathematics.
* Vancouver, B.C. native, but a Mazama, WA local. Google map: [Mazama, WA](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Mazama,+Winthrop,+Washington,+%C3%89tats-Unis/@48.5920655,-120.4740241,19140m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x5483537fbb9e3e41:0x73f3b923e86b8876!2m2!1d-120.4039844!2d48.5920867!3e0). Rural, eh?
* Former Rotary Youth Exchange student to Annecy, France. Check out my [blogspot](http://dmottinfrance.blogspot.com) about my French adventures.

*Very random facts about me that you may find interesting...*

* I once bumped into two black bears üêª while hiking and ran away. This is absolutely NOT what you're supposed to do. Please visit the [beartsmart webpage](http://www.bearsmart.com/play/bear-encounters/) if you would like to know how to react if you encounter a bear. 
* My favourite spectacle is a Russian opera called "Lady Macbeth of Mtsenk". It's about a woman who murders her husband to be with her lover Sergei. Hidden in this tale of love and violence is a clever condemnation of Joseph Stalin's authoritarian rule. See this [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/26/classicalmusicandopera.russia) for more information. üëÄ
* I once did 13 pull-ups in a row. You could too! Like anything, all it takes is practice.
